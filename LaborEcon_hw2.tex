\section{Robinson Crusoe's Coconuts Revisited}
Recall our settings from homework 1. This time, 
Robinson Crusoe's utility is a CRRA function 
\begin{equation*}
    u(c; \gamma) = \lim_{\gamma'\to\gamma}\frac{c^{1-\gamma'}}{1-\gamma'}
\end{equation*}
with $\gamma\geq 0$. At the beginning of each period 
$t$, Crusoe owns $y_t$ coconuts. He 
can either consume them or plant them. If he plants 
$k_{t+1}$ coconuts, he will obtain $y_{t+1} = 
z_{t+1}f(k_{t+1})$ coconuts in the next period, where 
$z_{t+1}\overset{iid}{\sim} Lognormal(\mu,\sigma^2)$. 
The coconuts rot after each period, thus $k_t$ 
is fully depreciated. We assume that $f(k) = 
k^\alpha$ with $\alpha \in (0,1)$. With discount 
factor $\beta\in(0,1)$, Crusoe's problem is 
\begin{equation*}
    \max_{\{c_t,k_{t+1}\}_{t=0}^\infty} \sum_{t=0}^\infty 
    \E_0\sbrc{\beta^t u(c_t)} \quad \text{s.t.} \quad 
    c_t + k_{t+1} = y_t \quad \text{and} \quad y_{t+1} = 
    z_{t+1}f(k_{t+1})
\end{equation*} 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Write down the Bellman equation and define the Bellman operator. 
    \item Show that the Bellman operator is a contraction mapping.\\
    (Hint: Verify the Blackwell's sufficient conditions.)
    \item Given $\alpha = 0.8$, $\beta = 0.96$, $\gamma = 1$, $\mu = 0.0$, $\sigma = 0.3$. 
    Solve the model by value function iteration for $y\in(0,10)$.\\
    (Hint: You may use the linear interpolation and monte carlo simulation to 
    approximate the expectation of $v$.)
    \item Given the same parameters, solve the model by policy function 
    iteration. 
    \item Given the same parameters, solve the model by the endogenous grid 
    method. Compare the running time of the three methods using macro 
    \texttt{@benchmark} in Julia. 
    \item The model has a famous closed-form solution with $\gamma = 1$:
    \begin{equation*}
        c^*(y) = (1-\alpha\beta)y.
    \end{equation*}
    Plot the consumption policies for the analytical and numerical solutions. 
    Do your the numerical solutions fit the analytical one well?
    \item Solve the model for $\sigma = 0.1, 0.015, 0.2, 0.25$ and $0.3$ with 
    $\gamma = 1.5$. Plot the consumption policies for different $\sigma$. 
    Explain your findings. 
\end{enumerate}
