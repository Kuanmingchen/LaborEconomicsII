\section{Methodology}
Illustrate the procedure of investigating the economic 
questions via the structural model approach.

\begin{sol}[2]
    In general, the structural model approach consists of four 
    steps:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Modeling:} Formulate the economic problem 
        and the environment. 
        \item \textbf{Solving:} Solve the model to obtain the 
        policy functions or the equilibrium. 
        \item \textbf{Estimation:} Estimate the model parameters
        using the obtained policy functions or the equilibrium and 
        the data. Find the parameters that produce the best fits 
        between the model and the data. 
        \item \textbf{Counterfactual Analysis:} Conduct the 
        policy experiments. For example, one may ask what if 
        the minimum wage increases by 10\%?
    \end{enumerate}
    Typically the most difficult parts are the solving and the estimation 
    steps. However, one should always keep in mind that the 
    counterfactual analysis is the ultimate goal of the entire 
    research.

\section{Robinson Crusoe's Coconuts}
Robinson Crusoe finds $z_0$ units of coconut on the beach in 
the morning of day $0$. Each day, he can either consume the 
coconuts or leave them for the next day. If he consumes $c_t$ 
coconuts on day $t$, he will have $z_{t+1} = z_t - c_t$. In 
each day, the utility of consuming $c_t$ coconuts is $u(c_t) = 
\sqrt{c_t}$. Furthermore, the coconuts will rot at the end of 
day $T$. Given the time discount factor $\beta\in(0,1)$, 
Crusoe's prblem is thus formulated as follows: 
\begin{equation*}
    \max_{\{c_t\}_{t=0}^T} \sum_{t=0}^T \beta^t u(c_t) 
    \quad \text{s.t.} \quad z_{t+1} = z_t - c_t. 
\end{equation*}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Write down the value function $v(z, t)$ and the 
    Bellman equation. 
    \item Write down the first-order condition of the problem. 
    \item Solve the optimal consumption $c^*_0$ corresponding 
    to $z_0$ analytically. 
    \item Now instead of the coconuts, Crusoe finds $z_0$ units 
    of canned food. Since the canned food will not rot, the 
    problem is formulated as 
    \begin{equation*}
        \max_{\{c_t\}_{t=0}^\infty} \sum_{t=0}^\infty \beta^t u(c_t) 
        \quad \text{s.t.} \quad z_{t+1} = z_t - c_t.
    \end{equation*}
    Write down the value function and the Bellman equation. 
    Solve the optimal consumption $c^*_0$ corresponding to 
    $z_0$ analytically.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{sol}[3.1]
    The value function is 
    \begin{equation*}
        v(z, t) = \max_{\set{c_s}_{s=t}^T} \sum_{s=t}^T \beta^s u(c_s) 
    \end{equation*}
    with $z = \sum_{s=t}^{T}c_s$. The Bellman equation is 
    \begin{equation*}
        v(z, t) = \max_{c_{t}} \brc{u(c_t) + \beta v(z-c_t, t+1)}.
    \end{equation*}
    \solend
\end{sol}
\begin{sol}[3.2]
    The F.O.C. is 
    \begin{equation*}
        u'(c_t) = \beta u'(c_{t+1})\quad \forany t = 0,1,\ldots,T-1.
    \end{equation*}
    Since $u(c_t) = \sqrt{c_t}$, the F.O.C. becomes 
    \begin{equation*}
        \frac{1}{2\sqrt{c_t}} = \beta \frac{1}{2\sqrt{c_{t+1}}}.
    \end{equation*}
    \solend
\end{sol}
\begin{sol}[3.3]
    Rearranging the F.O.C. yields 
    \begin{equation*}
        c_{t+1} = \beta^2 c_t.
    \end{equation*}
    Combining this with the budget constraint $z_0 = 
    \sum_{s=0}^{T}c_s$, we have 
    \begin{equation*}
        z_0 = c_0 + \beta^2 c_0 + \cdots + \beta^{2T}c_0 
        = c_0 \sum_{s=0}^{T} \beta^{2s} = c_0 \frac{1-\beta^{2(T+1)}}{1-\beta^2}.
    \end{equation*}
    Thus 
    \begin{equation*}
        c^*_0 = \frac{z_0(1-\beta^2)}{1-\beta^{2(T+1)}}.
    \end{equation*}
    \solend
\end{sol}
\begin{sol}[3.4]
    Taking the limit as $T\to\infty$, the value function is 
    \begin{equation*}
        v(z) = \max_{\set{c_s}_{s=t}^\infty} \sum_{s=t}^\infty \beta^s u(c_s). 
    \end{equation*}
    Observe that the value function doe not depend on $t$ since 
    today's problem is the same as tomorrow's. \\
    The Bellman equation becomes
    \begin{equation*}
        v(z) = \max_{c} \brc{u(c) + \beta v(z-c)}.
    \end{equation*}
    The F.O.C. is the same as \textit{3.3}. Thus the optimal 
    consumption is 
    \begin{equation*}
        c^*_0 = z_0(1-\beta^2)
    \end{equation*}
    by taking $T\to\infty$.
    \solend
\end{sol}

\section{McCall's Job Search Model}
A worker is finding a job. In each period, the worker receives 
a job offer with wage $w_t$. The wage is i.i.d. across periods 
in $Beta(\alpha,\beta)$. The worker can either 
accept the offer ($s_t=1$) and work at the wage $w_t$ forever 
or reject it ($s_t=0$) and receives $\underbar{c}$ as the 
unemployment benefit. Once the worker accepts an offer, he 
cannot search for another job or quit. Assume that the worker 
cannot borrow or save; thus $u(c_t)=w_t$. 
With the discount factor $\rho\in(0,1)$, the worker's problem 
is 
\begin{equation*}
    \max_{\{s_t\}_{t=0}^\infty} \E_0\sbrc{\sum_{t=0}^\infty \rho^t(w_ts_t+(1-s_t)\underbar{c})}\quad \text{s.t. $\Set{s_t}{s_t\in\set{0,1}}$ is a non-decreasing sequence}.
\end{equation*}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Write down the Bellman equation.
    \item Define the Bellman operator and verify that it is a 
    contraction mapping on the space of bounded continuous functions 
    defined on $[0,1]$ with the supremum norm.\\
    (Hint: $\abs{\max\brc{a,b}-\max\brc{a,c}}\leq\abs{b-c}$ for real $a,b,c$.)
    \item Given $\rho = 0.95$, $\underbar{c} = 0.1$, $\alpha = 2$, 
    and $\beta = 5$, solve the model numerically.
    \item Plot the value function and the optimal policy function as functions 
    of $w$. What is the reservation wage? 
    \item Simulate the model for 1000 agents. Plot the distribution of the 
    time to find a job.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{sol}[4.1]
    The Bellman equation is 
    \begin{equation*}
        v(w) = \max \brc{\frac{w}{1-\rho}, \underbar{c} + \rho \int v(w') F(dw')},
    \end{equation*}
    where $F$ is the CDF of $Beta(\alpha,\beta)$.
    \solend
\end{sol}
\begin{sol}[4.2]
    The Bellman operator is 
    \begin{equation*}
        (Tv)(w) = \max \brc{\frac{w}{1-\rho}, \underbar{c} + \rho \int v(w') F(dw')}.
    \end{equation*}
    Now let $v_1$ and $v_2$ be two bounded continuous functions on $[0,1]$ and 
    $\norm{\cdot}$ denote the supremum norm. Then
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{aligned}
            \norm{Tv_1 - Tv_2} &= \sup_{w\in[0,1]}\Bigg\lvert\max\brc{\frac{w}{1-\rho}, \underbar{c} + \rho \int v_1(w') F(dw')}\\ 
            &\qquad- \max\brc{\frac{w}{1-\rho}, \underbar{c} + \rho \int v_2(w') F(dw')}\Bigg\rvert \\
            &\leq \sup_{w\in[0,1]}\abs{\rho \int v_1(w') F(dw') - \rho \int v_2(w') F(dw')}\\ 
            &\leq \rho \int \sup_{w\in[0,1]}\abs{v_1(w') - v_2(w')} F(dw')\\
            &= \rho \int \norm{v_1 - v_2} F(dw') = \rho \norm{v_1 - v_2}.
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation*}
    Thus $T$ is a contraction mapping. \solend \\
    \textit{An Alternative Approach:} \\
    One may observe that there exists a ``reservation wage'', $\Bar{w}$, 
    where the worker is indifferent between accepting and rejecting the 
    offer. That is,
    \begin{equation*}
        \frac{\Bar{w}}{1-\rho} = \underbar{c} + \rho \int v(w') F(dw').
    \end{equation*} 
    By the Bellman equation, substituting $v(w')$ yields
    \begin{equation*}
        \frac{\Bar{w}}{1-\rho} = \underbar{c} + \rho \int \max\brc{\frac{w'}{1-\rho}, \frac{\Bar{w}}{1-\rho}} F(dw'), 
    \end{equation*}
    which is equivalent to 
    \begin{equation*}
        \Bar{w} = (1-\rho)\underbar{c} + \rho \int \max\brc{w', \Bar{w}} F(dw').
    \end{equation*}
\end{sol}
\begin{sol}[4.2. Conti]
    Define the new operator $U$ defined on $[0,1]$ as 
    \begin{equation*}
        U\Bar{w} = (1-\rho)\underbar{c} + \rho \int \max\brc{w', \Bar{w}} F(dw').
    \end{equation*}
    We claim that $U$ is a contraction mapping. \\
    Let $\Bar{w}_1, \Bar{w}_2\in[0,1]$. Then 
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{aligned}
            \abs{U\Bar{w}_1 - U\Bar{w}_2} 
            &= \abs{\rho \int \max\brc{w', \Bar{w}_1} F(dw') - \rho \int \max\brc{w', \Bar{w}_2} F(dw')}\\
            &= \rho\abs{\int \max\brc{w', \Bar{w}_1}-\max\brc{w', \Bar{w}_2} F(dw')}\\
            &\leq \rho \int\abs{\max\brc{w', \Bar{w}_1}-\max\brc{w', \Bar{w}_2}} F(dw')\\
            &\leq \rho \int\abs{\Bar{w}_1-\Bar{w}_2} F(dw') = \rho \abs{\Bar{w}_1-\Bar{w}_2}\int F(dw') = \rho \abs{\Bar{w}_1-\Bar{w}_2}.
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation*}
